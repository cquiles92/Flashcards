Flashcards/Flashcards/task/src/flashcards/
Is the directory for the source files.

This is a simple project to create virtual flashcards using the console for input and output. It can create flashcards to help study and can save and load cards.
This program can save the file to a given filename and import cards as well. It also has command line parameters to be able to save on exit or import cards on startup.
The flashcards in this program should not have any repeated definitions or repeated cards, and each card has a mistake counter internally to help with studies.
